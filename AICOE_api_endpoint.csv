"Alright knucklehead, China built more solar in just the last year than the **entire US installed solar capacity**.

They've now cornered the global market on solar and have a massive export industry.

Biden's infrastructure plan gave the US clean tech industry a shot in the arm, but smooth brains like you are still clinging to ""drill baby drill""."
"I was referring to this where France opposed any increase in fuel taxes: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests

I suppose they are still better equipped to reduce emissions out of most Western countries, but in their case they decided that wealth inequality was as or more important to tackle first. Which I completely understand. 

I used to think that the Citizen’s Climate Lobby was the best shot for the US getting their shit together. Maybe it still is, but with the current US political landscape there is absolutely no way it’s going to happen. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens'_Climate_Lobby"
"Alright Greta, US 3,809,525 sq mi,  UK  94,354 sq mi. Size matters, we have climates from perma-frost to death valley. I'm not peddling my fat ass to work while China burns the fuck out of coal and oil across the world. That's some Bubba Gump intelligence."
so...war it is...
"Thanks for typing that out, but my goal wasn't to pack a precise and nuanced economic treatise in those two sentences, that's not the normal standard for reddit comments in WSB, just pointing out that we're currently running a massive fiscal stimulus via government spending, which is similar in many ways to what WW2 did in terms of stimulating the economy. Because of the debt, WW2 was followed by huge currency devaluations/lowering the peg against gold. I think it has a lot of similarities to that scenario, but spending on infrastructure and bond holders rather than weapons factories. The IRA is a *huge* investment. The Loan Program Office alone has loan authority of like $400B for clean energy projects.

Besides pure materiel, a lot of the wartime spending went toward things that helped with industrial production afterwards, it's not that different in terms of trying to spur growth."
She should be more specific. 8.6 trillion plus one head of a billionaire on a stake each year for sacrifice. It’s mostly preventative. 1 less yacht from setting sail each week.
"China has the most coal-fired power plants in the world, with 1,142 operational plants on the Chinese mainland as of July 2023. China is also responsible for building the majority of new coal power plants globally, accounting for 95% of new construction in 2023. This was 19 times more than the rest of the world's construction, and China's 47.4 GW of new coal power capacity accounted for two-thirds of the global increase in operating capacity. Via Carbon Brief. Biden can do what he wants we can live by candlelight and shit in holes and we'll never erase what they're doing Globally. So yeah, it's a pipe dream until everyone is on board with their checkbook."
France is like 80% nuclear tho
"I guess I was trying to say that a $15k BYD car at 0% APR for 24mo would make waves in the market. That's why we're keeping them out. 

They'd pull some loss-leader strat fuckery and flood the EV market with cheap EVs that aren't state/fed subsidized. Cars in that price range with low ball financing could cripple US autos."
"Google it I guess, I'm not searching for an article I saw years ago in a language you probably don't understand anyway"
"My authority is not measured in mod powers.

It is measured in magick and witchcraft and runic glory.

I will fuck people up in nightmares, not on the sub.

"i mean you cluld do a year or more if youd like. a leap is an option of 6-12 months so over a year technically isnt a leap,,, i dont know what it would be called. that said more time never hurts; just means youll have to put up more money and thereby be less leveraged so pick your strikes /deltas accordingly"

Bro won his bag on pure luck and he's Nutting on other bros face cuz he rolled the wrong dice.
He's got 100k of the inheritance in high yield savings account
I'n 10 years he won't be lol

I think your caps lock is broken. Or you’re 12.

"Wait so you made money, but the mistake is you didn’t make enough, lololo. Come back when the mistake costs you a 1/3 of your portfolio"
"You’re gambling with no better edge than 20 million other degenerates. You’re playing against a trillion dollars of big money with an edge that makes moved in microseconds on any news. Your true mistake is believing you’re doing d as nothing different than a grandma pulling a lever on a slot machine. Finally, if you do hit it big, you’ll give it all back thinking you’ve figured it out. Have a great day!"
"Just look up the stock on e.g. yahoo finance, click on news and scroll through."
"To a lesser level, the same thing happened with SERV (From $2 to $24) a couple of weeks before and with SAVA ($17 to $41) last week, on both I ended up loosing way more than what I earned initially. It sucks ass. I don’t think I’ll ever get over it, but I think of them as lessons now. Also, worst thing you can do is calculate how much you would have earned."
Kind of reminds me of Bynd that suckered retail to chase to $9 and then rugpulled back to 6 something all on Friday all within 1 hr
I don’t make life changing fuck ups
"I bought lumen at $12 and sold it at $3 a few years ago, just laugh now"
I swear he edited it. He said “I feel like I just lost 4k” at some point.
"Experience and time.

But tell me what strategy is it when you think it won't go higher but you choose to gamble anyway?

It wasn't skill it was just luck because it seems like you don't know what you are doing. I am not trying to be an asshole. I did really well when I first started and I knew nothing. Then I lost my profit, my initial investment and then lost some more money. Looking back, who the fuck was I thinking I knew better than the market?

Should be happy to you made some gains. I hope you sold."
And where did “I feel like I lost 4k” come from? Dudes all over the place here
"If you played the ec, they lost even more than was expected.  The September launch was already scheduled. There was no new news. Full disclosure I am a bag holder."
"I believe I seen it on LinkedIn, it was the 2 people talking from their respected locations. 
Maybe it was just one of our incredibly talented Sp🅰️cemob members work."
"Rally might still be happening , try for profit tmw (I missed the initial rally but made money Friday and today)"
"Will someone please tell me how to do this? The only stock I found was RKLB AT $6.84. I couldn't find CLOV, SOUN, RR, or SERV. I am so confused. I thought we were supposed to help one another."
"I’m new here

I saw a guy talk about RR like two weeks ago. Definitely money time there

I should follow more of these posts.,,"
"Oh for sure man, Imma hold this syock for ever"
That's exactly what I need. What was that?
Soun is gonna cook
">	Instead of exercising the option and acquiring the shares, he can sell the option to someone else for a profit, since the contract has risen in value.

What if no one wants to buy it? Will OP have to exercise or it will expire?"
"It was on LinkedIn, this is the first ever call utilizing AST Spacemobiles technology from 4 months ago. Maybe someone can figure out how to drag it over here to share with everyone.

![img](63ncis3rpmjd1)"
CLOV was a meme stock in 2021. I think I turned $250 into $2500 on calls overnight. But then I bought shares of the stock around $8 and it proceeded to tank to being worth like $0.50 cents or something over the course of a few months.
"No DD, regard calls, fingers crossed, moon"
"Genuinely, how do you get to know stocks like clov or asta before they blow up and get posted on Reddit? Is it twitter?"
"I’m new to this form of gambling, I mean investing.  Bought in at $2.50 a share and am happy with my small earnings so far.  

I’m just scared I’m going to start treating things like I used to treat the casino.  I stopped gambling when I got married, but this is investing, right?  Right?"
CLOV 🍀🍀🍀
is CLOV gonna keep climbing?
Do you think Clov has enough fuel to continue on?
Wish I knew how to do this.  So close yet so far.  If I did I wouldn't need to work for a living :/
"I found it originally on reddit. idk what forum. I was really hooked after I watched a few AL stock trades deep dive videos on it. I bought my first share at 0.88, so I would say I'm just unrealistically lucky with my timing in finding it. For the most part, just keep your eyes open and dig deep before tossing cash at any company. Oh and not FA but don't buy into BioPharma stonks unless you're planning to short it like 90% of them get squashed"
🦍
Theeebus Thhhhrrrissssst imagine what I could do with this money?
anyone still bullish on nvdia?
Ops username checks out.
Update? Are you still alive OP?
I wouldn’t check my portfolio or read the news today if I was OP
"I still remember my brother in law telling me the only thing I had to buy was Nortel and I would be set 
I have a stock that’s up 211% in about 5 months, greed tells me it’s going to be the next 20000 Percenter  reality: I will sell either when I can buy a citation or a 152"
"But people on a yachts did not get there by yolo’ing or diamond-handing option calls or puts. This guy bought NVDA calls at $120, have these been shares, he could hold and he’d be up by eoy,"
"Not sure if this is for me, but I’m also a long term holder. I don’t typically post here, I come to observe the wildlife. 

I also hold most of my investments in VOO and VTI, but I bought a nice chunk of NVDA in 2018, sold my initial stake, bought two cars, and I’m still up like 500%. So I agree. And I admit I got lucky on NVDA (although it wasn’t a lark of a buy, I had done my research), I just don’t think doom and gloom is justified yet."
Bro come on
 Fex
If you scroll up you'll see that I'm not the one that's advocating for excessive day trades lol 😆
"If you think you can outperform the market with your day trades, what are you doing posting on here and why aren't you on an island getting your dick or pussy sucked?"
"damn, no wonder you fucking degens flock to Robbin’ Hood.

what’s the max leverage one can take out in an account from there?"
"It can be annoying too though, I bought the dip today (SPY calls) but it kept dipping, so I sold. Because cash takes a day to settle, I had no buying power left to rebuy lower. If you have a small account, you get very few trades per day, and only 1-2 big trades."
I would sell anyway even if banned.
"That won't work.  Switching to cash isn't instantaneous, it's next trading day.  You'll be flagged ptd and can't go back unless you close at 25K or still have your one get of jail free card."
They’re called instant deposits. Depends on your balance usually between 1k-5K but can be much higher depending on your portfolio
That was before it popped. Bit Nvidia broke his break even price. So what's the update? How much did you make?
I’ve switched my margin account to cash to bypass the day trading rule over 10 times and never had an issue. While you have the trade you can switch the account and close the trade with no penalty. After about 5 trading days you can switch back to margin. And should you be in this type of situation again you can do it again. Never been flagged and actually did it again last week cause I wanted to close a day trade on $QQQ.
Given that you’re on this sub I could ask you the same.
just have to drive to a truck stop
"Why do y’all insist on buying shit stocks just because they pumped? Do you not understand how the market works?

This isn’t even gambling, at least if you bet it all on black you have a 50% chance of winning."
"You can check out investopedia, they explain all the basics of investing pretty good"
Forgot??? 😅 To add SL? Muahahaha
You sound like you have a ton of money if you were able to recover $55k by trading shares of AAPL and NVDA after losing $86k. OP put his life savings into this so I don't think he has another $100k lying around to play with
Ouch! Time to rebuild brother one day at a time and work on your trading discipline!
"MACD/RSI for the buy trigger on a reversal, it's a classic strategy. Look at different timeframes first and read the charts, then you just gotta pray it moves enough to make some money."
Now you know how you got to the 40k- hard work- just keep stacking and learn from your mistakes.
"Lost $80k trading options on Webull (over 18 months... learning, trading and gambling), took a break for a few months, then opened a RH account with only $1000 (blew that 5 times...down $5900). Stopped trading options and started trading shares (i.e. buying $AAPL $NVDA on big dips)... I've since made back $55k and life is great. There's hope, but stay away from options. ;) ...I only come back to WSB as a reminder to not trade options. Keep ya head up!"
"Of course, I've cut my losses many times. Only by manually trading out, not via stop-loss. I've also held some bags. Those things are almost inevitable. I don't trade options or penny stocks. The large cap stocks typically do not go bankrupt overnight (and even if they did, stop loss won't help for overnight crashes). It is perfectly possible to invest (not daytrade) without stop-loss."
"+40% today

I don't think LUNR is a bad company, I just think that WSB is habitual about hype. TSLA, NIO, AMC, BB, LUNR and so on. There's an initial hype and then people forget about the stock and there's a retracement. I think LUNR is one of only two companies on that list that would go up long term due to their technology, but I'm just here for the implied volatility.

If it helps, I lost most of that $95 on my NVDA calls. I am no moni"
"Wow you made money on puts - I just bought 15k shares @ 7.8 and sold it at 9.05 

Easiest money I will make"
"I'm pretty sure the slow burn down is intentional. I'm pretty sure the CEO has been \*wanting\* privatization. It's showing all the signs & symptoms. Obvious underutilization of resources, shuffling of board members, moves to encourage delisting of the stocks, actual EPS being higher than predicted EPS, etc."
"Wasn’t Nvidia, but it looks like Qualcomm is interested.  I wasn’t wrong about buy potential🤷🏻‍♂️"
Sarcastic?
"I ended up buying back my covered call, sold my 5.00 calls when were up at 9.50 and sold my LUNR shares for a 60% gain yesterday. Waiting for it to fall to reenter"
"Sir, or ma'am, I'd like to respond saying I was wrong as shit, you can probably buy back your calls for decent gains."
Sell Elgoog
"  
CCL doesnt move because of the chart, it moves because its making more and more money and people realize its cheap."
Dude did you make bank?
